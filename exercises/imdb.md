## Deliverables

It is 1995 and you are building out IMDB. Take some time to think about the
relationships you need to build the site.

Movies >>>> Characters(has only one actor) <<<< Shows
Actors >>>>

- your models are movies, shows, characters and actors
  - movies and shows have many characters
  - actors have many characters
  - characters only have one actor (for this model)
  - characters may have multiple movies or shows
  - what other relationships exist?
- for an extra twist, afterwards throw episodes into the mix and see how the
  relationships change
  - a show has many episodes
  - an episode has many characters

These are not simple relationships, so take some time creating them. Write out
the relationships using has_many, belongs_to and has_many_through. Write out a
schema that shows what these tables might look like in a database. Where would
the foreign keys live? Then *build out methods reflecting all these
relationships.* What method can I call on a movie to find all its actors, etc?

#### Movie

- .most_actors
  - should return the movie which has the most actors in it. this is so the
    studio knows never to hire that director again because he/she makes
    expensive movies

#### Show

- #on_the_big_screen
  - should return Movies that share the same name as this Show

#### Character

- .most_appearances
  - should return which character of film/television appears in the most films
    or tv shows

#### Actor

- .most_characters
  - should return which actor has the most different characters played.
    (probably meryl streep)
